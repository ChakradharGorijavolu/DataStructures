# DataStructures

Till now i have written code for linear search and binary search 
they are searching algorithms for small data sets
//Time complexity for linear search is :
 Best case   :o(1)                                                                    
 Worst case   :o(n)                                                                    
Average case :o(n)

//Time complexity for binary search is :
 Best case   :o(1)                                                                    
 Worst case   :o(nlogn)                                                                    
Average case :o(nlogn)
