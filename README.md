# Searching Techniques
--------------------------------
Till now i have written code for linear search and binary search 
they are searching algorithms for small data sets
//Time complexity for linear search is :
 Best case   :o(1)                                                                    
 Worst case   :o(n)                                                                    
Average case :o(n)

//Time complexity for binary search is :
 Best case   :o(1)                                                                    
 Worst case   :o(nlogn)                                                                    
Average case :o(nlogn)

# 1-D Arrays

Array is collection of data with same data type elements
It is Static in Nature
It have a fixed size

# 2-D Arrays

A 2-dimensional array, often defined as 2D array, is an array of arrays. 
It represents a tabular data structure with rows and columns. 
2D arrays are commonly used to represent grids, matrices, tables, images, and other tabular data structures in programming. 

# 3-D Arrays

A 3-dimensional array, often defined as 3D array, is an array of arrays of arrays. 
A 3D array can be visualized as a collection of stacked 2D arrays. Each "layer" represents a 2D array, and these layers are stacked on top of each other to form the 3D structure.
3D arrays are useful for representing volumetric data in scientific computing, such as medical imaging (e.g., MRI scans), 3D graphics in computer games and simulations, and any other data that has three-dimensional spatial characteristics.
